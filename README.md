## -------------------------------[ DIRECTIVE ]--------------------------------
### As a Junior Software Engineer, you’ve been tasked with developing a frontend application using Angular. Your goal is to research and implement data fetching via GraphQL within the Angular project. You can leverage the knowledge you gained in the COMP 3133 course at George Brown College.

### The project will be maintained in a Git repository named studentID_comp3133_assignment2. If you choose to make the repository private, please add me as a collaborator (username: pritamworld).

### Your evaluation will focus on how well you organize your source code, as well as how effectively you utilize Angular features such as components, data binding, services, pipes, routing, and security.

### Use Assignment I as the backend to develop the frontend for Assignment II. At the end, you will deploy both the backend and frontend to a cloud platform of your choice, such as Heroku, Vercel, or Cyclic. Be sure to update the backend as needed to accommodate the frontend requirements.
